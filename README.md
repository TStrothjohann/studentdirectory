#The Makers Academy Student Directory

In this tutorial I'm building a student directory. It will have the following features:

- Show the list of all students
- ordered by name
- grouped by cohort (as an exercise)
- Add new students by asking the user to input the names
- Show information about a given student
- Add information related to a particular student (e.g. hobbies)
- Interactive menu to ask the user what he or she would like to do
- Displaying aggregate info (statistics)
- Saving this data to a file
- Loading it from the file

The script will be invoked from the command-line and it will only use pure Ruby, that is, there will be no external libraries to use.
